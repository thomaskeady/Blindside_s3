%% Track a Car-Like Robot Using Particle Filter
%% Introduction
% Particle filter is a sampling-based recursive Bayesian estimation
% algorithm. It is implemented in |<docid:robotics_ref.bu31dpn-1 robotics.ParticleFilter>|.
% In the <docid:robotics_examples.example-TurtleBotMonteCarloLocalizationExample
% Localize TurtleBot using Monte Carlo Localization> example, we have seen the  
% application of particle filter to track the pose of a robot against a known
% map. The measurement is made through 2D laser scan. In this example,
% the scenario is a little bit different: a remote-controlled car-like robot 
% is being tracked in the outdoor environment. The robot pose measurement is now 
% provided by an on-board GPS, which is noisy. We also know the motion commands
% sent to the robot, but the robot will not execute the exact commanded motion  
% due to mechanical part slacks and/or model inaccuracy. This example will show 
% how to use |<docid:robotics_ref.bu31dpn-1 robotics.ParticleFilter>| to reduce
% the effects of noise in the measurement data and get a more accurate estimation
% of the pose of the robot. The kinematic model of a car-like robot is
% described by the following non-linear system. The particle filter is
% ideally suited for estimating the state of such kind of systems, as it
% can deal with the inherent non-linearities.

% *Scenario*: The car-like robot drives and changes its velocity and steering
%             angle continuously. The pose of the robot is measured by some
%             noisy external system, e.g. a GPS or a Vicon system. Along the
%             path it will drive through a roofed area where no 
%             measurement can be made.
%
% *Input*:
%
% * The noisy measurement on robot's partial pose ($x$, $y$, $\theta$). *Note* this 
%   is not a full state measurement. No measurement is available on the front wheel 
%   orientation ($\phi$) as well as all the velocities ($\dot{x}$, $\dot{y}$, 
%   $\dot{\theta}$, $\dot{\phi}$). 
%   
% * The linear and angular velocity command sent to the robot ($v_c$,
%             $\omega_c$). *Note* there will be some difference between the
%             commanded motion and the actual motion of the robot.
%
% *Goal*:     Estimate the partial pose ($x$, $y$, $\theta$) 
%             of the car-like robot. *Note* again that the
%             wheel orientation ($\phi$) is not included in the estimation.
%             *From the observer's perspective*, the full state of the car is
%             only [ $x$, $y$, $\theta$, $\dot{x}$, $\dot{y}$,
%             $\dot{\theta}$ ].
%  
%
% *Approach*: Use |<docid:robotics_ref.bu31dpn-1 robotics.ParticleFilter>|
%             to process the two noisy inputs (neither of the 
%             inputs is reliable by itself) and make best estimation of
%             current (partial) pose. 
%
% * At the *predict* stage, we update the states of the
%             particles with a simplified, unicycle-like robot model, as shown below.
%             Note that the system model used for state estimation is not an
%             exact representation of the actual system. This is acceptable, as
%             long as the model difference is well-captured in the system
%             noise (as represented by the particle swarm). For more
%             details, see |<docid:robotics_ref.bu357ss-1
%             robotics.ParticleFilter.predict>|.

% \hspace{1cm}\dot{y} &= v \sin(\theta) \\ 
% \hspace{1cm}\dot{\theta} &= \omega \end{array} 
% $$
%
% * At the *correct* stage, the importance weight (likelihood) of a
%              particle is determined by its error norm from current
%              measurement ($\sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2 + (\Delta\theta)^2}$), 
%              as we only have measurement on these three components. For
%              more details, see |<docid:robotics_ref.bu357tj-1

%% Initialize a Car-like Robot
rng('default'); % for repeatable result
dt = 0.05; % time step
initialPose = [0  0  0  0]';
carbot = ExampleHelperCarBot(initialPose, dt); 

return; % Causes plot to appear

%% Set up the Particle Filter
% This section configures the particle filter using 5000 particles.
% Initially all particles are randomly picked from a normal distribution with mean
% at initial state and unit covariance. Each particle contains 6 state variables
% ($x$, $y$, $\theta$, $\dot{x}$, $\dot{y}$, $\dot{\theta}$). Note that the third            
% variable is marked as Circular since it is the car orientation.
% It is also very important to specify two callback functions |StateTransitionFcn|
% and |MeasurementLikelihoodFcn|. These two functions directly determine
% the performance of the particle filter. The details of these two
% functions can be found the in the last two sections of this example.
pf = robotics.ParticleFilter;

initialize(pf, 5000, [initialPose(1:3)', 0, 0, 0], eye(6), 'CircularVariables',[0 0 1 0 0 0]);
pf.StateEstimationMethod = 'mean';
pf.ResamplingMethod = 'systematic';

% StateTransitionFcn defines how particles evolve without measurement
pf.StateTransitionFcn = @exampleHelperCarBotStateTransition;

% MeasurementLikelihoodFcn defines how measurement affect the our estimation
pf.MeasurementLikelihoodFcn = @exampleHelperCarBotMeasurementLikelihood;

% Last best estimation for x, y and theta
lastBestGuess = [0 0 0];

%% Main Loop 
% Note in this example, the commanded linear and angular velocities to the robot are
% arbitrarily-picked time-dependent functions. Also note the fixed-rate timing
% of the loop is realized through 
% |<docid:robotics_ref.mw_9b7bd9b2-cebc-4848-a38a-2eb93d51da03 robotics.Rate>|.

% Run loop at 20 Hz for 20 seconds
% Use fixed-rate support 
r = robotics.Rate(1/dt);
% Reset the fixed-rate object
reset(r);

% Reset simulation time
simulationTime = 0; 

%return;

while simulationTime < 20 % if time is not up

    % Generate motion command that is to be sent to the robot
    % NOTE there will be some discrepancy between the commanded motion and the
    % motion actually executed by the robot. 
    uCmd(1) = 0.7*abs(sin(simulationTime)) + 0.1;  % linear velocity
    uCmd(2) = 0.08*cos(simulationTime);            % angular velocity
    
    drive(carbot, uCmd);
        
    % Predict the carbot pose based on the motion model
    [statePred, covPred] = predict(pf, dt, uCmd);

    % Get GPS reading
    measurement = exampleHelperCarBotGetGPSReading(carbot);

    % If measurement is available, then call correct, otherwise just use
    % predicted result
    if ~isempty(measurement)
        [stateCorrected, covCorrected] = correct(pf, measurement');
    else
        stateCorrected = statePred;
        covCorrected = covPred;
    end

    lastBestGuess = stateCorrected(1:3);

    % Update plot
    if ~isempty(get(groot,'CurrentFigure')) % if figure is not prematurely killed
        updatePlot(carbot, pf, lastBestGuess, simulationTime);
    else
        break
    end

    waitfor(r);
    
    % Update simulation time
    simulationTime = simulationTime + dt;
end

%% Details of the Result Figures
% The three figures show the tracking performance of the particle filter. 
%
% * In the first figure, the particle filter is tracking the car well as it
% drives away from the initial pose.
%
% * In the second figure, the robot drives into the roofed area, where no
% measurement can be made, and the particles only evolve based on
% prediction model (marked with orange color). You can see the particles
% gradually form a horseshoe-like front, and the estimated pose gradually 
% deviates from the actual one. 
%
% * In the third figure, the robot has driven out of the roofed area. With new
% measurements, the estimated pose gradually converges back to the actual pose. 


%% State Transition Function 
% The sampling-based state transition function evolves the particles based on a
% prescribed motion model so that the particles will form a 
% representation of the proposal distribution. Below is an example of a
% state transition function based on the velocity motion model of a unicycle-like
% robot. For more details about this motion model, please see Chapter 5 in
% *[1]*. Decrease |sd1|, |sd2| and |sd3| to see how the tracking performance deteriorates.
% Here |sd1| represents the uncertainty in the linear velocity, |sd2|
% represents the uncertainty in the angular velocity. |sd3| is an
% additional perturbation on the orientation.
%
%     function predictParticles = exampleHelperCarBotStateTransition(pf, prevParticles, dT, u)
% 
%         thetas = prevParticles(:,3);
% 
%         w = u(2);
%         v = u(1);
% 
%         l = length(prevParticles);
% 
%         % Generate velocity samples
%         sd1 = 0.3;
%         sd2 = 1.5;
%         sd3 = 0.02;
%         vh = v + (sd1)^2*randn(l,1);  
%         wh = w + (sd2)^2*randn(l,1); 
%         gamma = (sd3)^2*randn(l,1); 
% 
%         % Add a small number to prevent div/0 error
%         wh(abs(wh)<1e-19) = 1e-19;
% 
%         % Convert velocity samples to pose samples
%         predictParticles(:,1) = prevParticles(:,1) - (vh./wh).*sin(thetas) + (vh./wh).*sin(thetas + wh*dT);
%         predictParticles(:,2) = prevParticles(:,2) + (vh./wh).*cos(thetas) - (vh./wh).*cos(thetas + wh*dT);
%         predictParticles(:,3) = prevParticles(:,3) + wh*dT + gamma*dT;
%         predictParticles(:,4) = (- (vh./wh).*sin(thetas) + (vh./wh).*sin(thetas + wh*dT))/dT;
%         predictParticles(:,5) = ( (vh./wh).*cos(thetas) - (vh./wh).*cos(thetas + wh*dT))/dT;
%         predictParticles(:,6) = wh + gamma;
% 
%     end
%
%% Measurement Likelihood Function
% The measurement likelihood function computes the likelihood for
% each predicted particle based on the error norm between particle and the
% measurement. The importance weight for each particle will be assigned based on the
% computed likelihood. In this particular example, |predictParticles| is a N x 6
% matrix (N is the number of particles), and |measurement| is a 1 x 3
% vector.
%
%     function  likelihood = exampleHelperCarBotMeasurementLikelihood(pf, predictParticles, measurement)
% 
%         % The measurement contains all state variables
%         predictMeasurement = predictParticles;
% 
%         % Calculate observed error between predicted and actual measurement
%         % NOTE in this example, we don't have full state observation, but only
%         % the measurement of current pose, therefore the measurementErrorNorm
%         % is only based on the pose error.
%         measurementError = bsxfun(@minus, predictMeasurement(:,1:3), measurement);
%         measurementErrorNorm = sqrt(sum(measurementError.^2, 2));
% 
%         % Normal-distributed noise of measurement
%         % Assuming measurements on all three pose components have the same error distribution 
%         measurementNoise = eye(3);
% 
%         % Convert error norms into likelihood measure. 
%         % Evaluate the PDF of the multivariate normal distribution 
%         likelihood = 1/sqrt((2*pi).^3 * det(measurementNoise)) * exp(-0.5 * measurementErrorNorm);
% 
%     end
