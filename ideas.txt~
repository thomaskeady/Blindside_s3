Ideas:

STF:
    Add distribution around previous estimate to encourage more particles to be near there
    Pull particles towards previous estimate? Not sure i like that
    
MLF:
    


General:
    Randomly throw down new particles 
    Plot distance circles on the plot to compare to particles

    MAKE THE WHOLE THING CLASSY - do week of 10/24 - 10-29
        class for plot
        class for real sensors
            toggle between real data and sim data - better or worse than using git branches?
        class for all model params so can modify in an isolated fashion
            Also toggle between models by changing filename

    Include ground truth, compare accuracy over parameter sweeps, output to files
