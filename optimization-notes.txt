-noise: .1:1 //~.3 seems best to me
-stdev: .6:10, broke at .5 not sure why
-state estimation: 'mean' or 'maxweight' //mean seems to work better by my eye
-ResamplingMethod: 'multinomial' or 'systematic'
-throw out large d //not sure this makes a difference, the particles are never on the large radii anyway
-weight by distance doesn't seem to work
-#particles: 500-10000


draw circle via stddev or area of particles?
