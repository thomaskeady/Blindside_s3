% Measurement should be raw vals from 6 sensors, all the math done here
%
function likelihood = mlf1_1(pf, predictParticles, measurement)
    
    % First map measurements to most-likely radius from each sensor
    % Get from Andrew
    
    % Then make distribution around each sensor (relative to origin!)
    
    
    
    % Sum all distributions on top of each other
    
    % Return summation
